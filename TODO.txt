1.  Extend the snapshot creation process and allow automatic refresh intervals

2.  Extend the PostgreSQL grammar to recognize "CREATE DBLINK", "DROP DBLINK", "CREATE SNAPSHOT", "DROP SNAPSHOT", "CREATE SNAPSHOT LOG", "DROP SNAPSHOT LOG" and "REFRESH SNAPSHOT" as native SQL commands.

3. Support scheduling of refreshes (based on date+interval)
